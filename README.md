# pyLabeler
pyLabeler is a Python based GUI tool for labelling datasets for various deep learning tasks. 
You can import the directory containing the dataset to be labelled and select the type of labels required. Currently, there are two options. Either you can get the coordinates of the labels or generate the binary mask based on the bounding box you draw.
